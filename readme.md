Pitch Report is a nyquist-style analyze plug-in for Audacity written in the nyquist variation of xlisp.

Pitch Report is used to generate a table of data measuring the fundamental pitch of guitar strings.

These data are collected in an apparatus that generates a constant tension force and allows measurement
of pitch at 650 mm and 325 mm scale lengths.

When measuring the pitch at 325 mm the distance the string is depressed by fretting is also measured.

These data along with additional measurements of physical properties of the strings are used to calculate
the longitudinal stiffness of each string which is then later used to calculate nut and saddle conpensation.
